#Recipes Book

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



## Get started
Clone the repo with:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/justyna13/RecipesBook.git
```

## Running the project

Install the npm packages described in the package.json and verify that it works:


```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The npm start command first compiles the application, then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the lite-server. Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
